# Client_Attrition_Risk_Prediction
# 🧠 Client Attrition Risk Prediction Model

This project is a Machine Learning-based system that predicts whether a client is likely to leave (churn) or stay with a company. By analyzing customer data, the model helps businesses take proactive retention measures to reduce attrition rates and improve customer satisfaction.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer attrition is a critical issue for many businesses. Retaining existing clients is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict client attrition using historical data and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Predict the likelihood of client attrition using historical features.
- Understand the most influential features behind client churn.
- Provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes features like:

- `Age`, `Gender`, `Income`, `Credit Score`
- `Account Balance`, `Customer Tenure`
- `Transaction History`, `Service Used`
- `Churn` (Target variable: 1 if churned, 0 otherwise)

> Dataset is either self-generated or obtained from a public source (e.g., Kaggle).

---

## 📈 Model Training

Several models were tested, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

The final model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric        | Value (example) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy      | 89.5%           |
| Precision     | 86.2%           |
| Recall        | 84.1%           |
| F1 Score      | 85.1%           |

> These metrics may vary based on the final model and dataset used.

## 📉 Feature Importance

Key features influencing churn:

- Low credit score
- Long tenure without upgrades
- Low product/service usage
- Poor customer support ratings
